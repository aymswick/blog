## Intro

At this exact moment on Earth, nature's symphony is accompanied by the persisten hum of
billions of tiny machines we have embedded into reality. These machines are dictated by
the slightest variance in electrical impulses and power the world economy, yet only a
small subset of us are privileged enough to ponder the implications fo such invisible
architecture. Fewer still have the magical combination of ability, power, and luck
required to actually influence the design and implementation of these systems which will
govern *all* of our lives. That is why as software developers, we have an urgent
responsibility to build *strictly and solely* systems which respect the rights of its
users, to educate our peers in other disciplines about the systems and their common
pitfalls, and to demand public ownership of essential infrastructure.
