You don't want to waste a chance at love. You spent your life architecting the future you thought you wanted, and you have brought much to fruition. However, in your quest to achieve maximum potency in all things you do, you stumbled into a realm that stripped away the layers of armor you'd mistaken for *you*. While searching for latent genetic treasures, you accidentally tumbled the lock on what you knew at birth and forgot sometime after preschool. Love is the most valuable experience a human could acquire, not because it is some spiritual marvel or because it is the divine subject of some stellar entanglement, but because that is what our biology craves more than shelter or food alone. Love is the difference between humans and animals, and lifted us from evolutionary struggle amongst violent, terrifying, powerful beasts.
