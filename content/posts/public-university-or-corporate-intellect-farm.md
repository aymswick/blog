Any system of university exists to create an informed and capable public, not, as
some neoconservative think-tanks might have you believe, as simply a
mechanism for employment in service of the Great Economic Machine.
What does it say about a culture when its brightest minds are busy
tinkering away in colorful, infantilized office playgrounds, aimed
narrowly at constructing marvelous contraptions for social addiction?
In 2020, a year of century-defining global pandemic, does the world
need more virtual mustaches, flirtatious extremism, and incessant
interruption? That there exist corporations valued in the trillions
headquartered in the same space where millions go hungry,
relegated to sleeping on the street? I believe it says that only a
privileged few ever really get a glimpse of the whole picture; only
those who are sufficiently free from financial panic are granted the
express freedom of true engagement with the perspective induced by
academia. If every member of a society were to peer into the
looking-glass, many would outright renounce their roles in the game. 

How then, are the blinders applied to those of extraordinary intellect? Simply, the
snake of industry has turned inward unto its own tail and inserted it
promptly into its mouth. Corporations too often form with innocuous
motives, acquire skilled members, find small success, and at this
point rather than attempt to sustain that success, make morally
dubious trade-offs in search of ever-greater success, repeating this
vicious cycle until someone spots an inevitable systemic failure and
escapes the sinking ship with armfuls of riches, leaving the rest of
the crew to drown. Before that cataclysm, as the spiral grows, the
enticement of the skilled laborer becomes more fiendish - salary,
stock options and meeting-rooms stocked with beer and games, all
serving the purpose of distracting a potential employee from their
societal responsibility to return the knowledge bestowed upon them by
the public school system to their peers! So efficient has this
university-to-tech-industry pipeline become, we barely perceive the
impropriety. You might feel it when you pass by the homeless and are
faced with the juxtaposition that you and they are one in the same,
yet you have a home and they have nothing, and you are primed
with no social response to this dilemma. Silicon Valley, San
Francisco, New York, insert tech hub here - all generating
lighting-fast networks of unprecedented technical marvel and massive
wealth alongside them. How can cities that scrape the sky be
so unwilling to provide for their boots on the ground? Where are all
the whiz-kids of pop-culture lore in the face of these problems?

Is this the purpose of higher education? Do we mean to siphon resources from public
domain to public nuisance? Can Big Tech quantifiably prove that the
unprecedented level of connection they provide enables a net-positive
for our social psyche? In the past three decades, we have all but
delegated the responsibility of these interrogations to the industry
which itself seeks to profit from not responding. When we ask the
Mark Zuckerbergs of the world if they can distinguish between
poisoning the well and providing clean water, we are left on read. 

Sometime in the last decade, while most of us were busy watching cat videos, the invisible
tubes that bring us information were hijacked by a handful of
profit-driven corporations. Unlike the prior owners of these tubes,
these companies have no interest in providing a standardized, neutral
“platform” by which anyone can “link” to and from disparate
information publishers - a model which drives traffic away from the
provider themself, thus earning no money. Instead, they seek to lure
their users into pits of despair by prostituting journalism into the
lowest common denominator of fear and disgust, serving up content
deliberately calculated to cause anxiety, and dangling in front of us
the shiny objects of desire, machine-curated with the compute power
of entire nations for each and every one of us.

All of this - ALL of it - done without our express permission, and always to our
individual and collective detriment. What happened here? It is of
twisted irony that the incarceration capital of the world and
birthplace of the most expedient information delivery network in
history are one in the same. With one hand, we hastily confine
millions of our own citizens for inhaling the smoke of naturally
occurring flora, and in the name of freedom, we use the other to
justify the unchecked propagation of conspiracy theories which
actively jeopardize public safety. When “entrepreneurs” used
racial minorities as slaves to build the great American railways to
accumulate the wealth of small kingdoms and ensure their continued
domination, albeit late, eventually a governing body stepped
forward to reign in this atrocious abuse of power. If, beneath the
festering pile of corporate lobbyists, the United States government
retains any vestige of democracy, it will show itself now in reigning
in the feudal lords of our darling web. If, after decades of
capitalist conditioning, we citizens retain some semblance of
self-worth, we will demand reallocation of intellectual wealth away
from predatory data brokers and toward our collective well-being.
