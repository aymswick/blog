Guilt is what I burned to finally embrace my role in living. For most of my life I felt like the catalyst in some chemical reaction gone wrong. I am a uniter, a mediator, the product of primal compromise. Guilt from my involvement in the destruction of two lives colored every experience I had, despite monumental effort on the part of my victims to conceal this fact. I craved recognition and refused to accept anything less than self-excellence, but shied away from attention out of certainty that I would disappoint or cause some deeply festering disdain to re-emerge within my audience.

I burned this creature that grew inside me when I was 22 years old in a fire of hallucinogenic bliss.
