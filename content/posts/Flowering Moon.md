Find me a planet with a flowering moon. A core so bright, a membrane so teeming with life that its excess leaks out into orbiting chunks of rock and forces them into the cosmic beauty contest. A world so pre-occupied with growing itself that it doesn't stop to notice it has inspired some other transformation entirely. Oxygen on a moon - an atmosphere at all - would be quite a feat. What makes a moon a moon? Does its classification necessitate an arid, lifeless signature, or can it be allowed to develop a culture, so long as it continues to revolve around the giving entity? Can a moon break off and take its newfound knowledge further into the galaxy, or is it bound by gravitational matrimony?
